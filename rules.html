	    <strong>Rules</strong>
	  </p>
	  <ol class="rules">
	    <li>Respect all other users, but especially Mumble staff members. The mods and admins have the final word on anything.</li>
	    <li>Do not give out the server address. The server is intended for Jupiter Broadcasting and its fans, not for random Internet users.</li>
	    <li>Do not transmit music or other potentially annoying sounds. The exception to this is when you are in a channel you or another user has created for the express purpose of transmitting audio for which you have the proper license to do so.</li>
	    <li>Kick Gamah, if you are able.</li>
	    <li>Recording via any method is strictly forbidden without the express permission of each and every person being recorded; not only is it devious, it is also illegal in places.
	      <ul>
		<li>The only exception to this rule is when you are recording in the On-Air Channel or Quiet Listening, during a show. You must still obtain permission, but only from the show host.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>We are particularly intolerant of hate speech and bigotry. You should expect to be kicked or worse if you use derogatory terms of any kind.</li>
	    <li>You must be thirteen (13) years of age or older to connect. If you are found—or even suspected—to be in violation of this rule, you will be immediately banned. You may appeal the ban if and when you are in compliance with the thirteen-year age requirement.</li>
	    <li>Do not post NSFW (Not Safe For Work) or explicit images directly in the client. You may link to this kind of content, but ONLY if you clearly mark it as such IN TEXT.</li>
	    <li>Discussion of topics which are prone to starting arguments or creating unnecessary friction between users should never take place directly in the lobby, or on the air. This includes (but is not limited to) religion, politics, or your own philosophical views on software licensing. If there is a registered user present, he or she can create a temporary subchannel under the lobby for such discussion.</li>
	    <li>Do not stalk other users. Seriously. It's creepy.</li>
	    <li>Bots of any kind are forbidden without the express permission of the admins.</li>
	    <li>Do not question the lack of rule #4.</li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    These rules are subject to change without notice.
