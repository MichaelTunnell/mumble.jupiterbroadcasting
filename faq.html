	  <strong>FAQs</strong>
	</p>
	<ol class="faqs">
	  <li><strong>Why is my avatar/comment/channel not remembered when I disconnect?</strong><br>
	    That data is only stored for registered users. This is a limitation of Murmur/Mumble.
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Why can't I register myself?</strong><br>
	    On this server, we use registration to assist with the mic-check process for shows. The "register user" permission can be easily granted to studio mods and it means that if you get disconnected for some reason after you've been staged for a show, you won't need to go through the queue again to get back into the On-Air Channel. At the end of the show, only those users who have been granted a persistent registration status will be allowed to remain registered.
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Can I be persistently registered?</strong><br>
	    In short: No.<br>
	    Staff members can nominate users for persistent registration. There are a few criteria we use to determine if a user should be nominated. First, he or she must have a consistently good audio configuration, as judged during the staging process for shows. Second, the user must demonstrate proper etiquette during said shows. Third, users who ask for persistent registration will not be nominated.
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Can I be a moderator?</strong><br>
	    In short: Nope.<br>
	    If more mods are required, we will decide who we offer positions to, and people who ask will not be on our list.
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Can I be an admin?</strong><br>
	    Hahaha. That's funny. You're funny.
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Why can't I join any channels or PM anyone?</strong><br>
	    This is most likely because an admin has turned on what we call "quarantine mode." This temporary mode locks all unregistered users in the root of the server. Contact a staff member by some other means if you wish to be moved out of root.
