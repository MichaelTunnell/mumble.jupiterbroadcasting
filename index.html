            <h1>Welcome to our Mumble Server!</h1>
            <h2>The following is a "Quick Start Guide" and is the only "required" reading for this server.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="content-subhead">How do I join the discussion?</h2>
            <p>
                A short tutorial(Written and updated by our amazing staff!) for getting up and running can be found here: <a href="setupMumble.html">mumble.jupiterbroadcasting.org/setupMumble.html</a>
            </p>
	    <p>
                You will need Mumble version 1.2.4 or higher. Support for the Opus audio codec we use was introduced in this version and Opus is required to communicate with other users here.
            </p>
	    <p>
	      Download instructions and more information about Mumble itself can be found at the project's official website: <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">www.mumble.info</a>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Sites such as mumble.com and others are <em>not affiliated with the Mumble project</em>.
	    </p>
	    

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Are there rules?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, though there really isn't that many. Rules are located at <a href="/rules.html">mumble.jupiterbroadcasting.org/rules.html</a>.
            </p>
	    <p>
	      If you think you may be about to or are breaking the rules <strong>STOP</strong> and ask a staff member for clarification.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Ignorance of the rules is not an excuse.(So go read <a href="rules.html">the rules</a>!) Bearing that in mind, staff members deal with rule violations on a case by case basis in as equitable a way as they can.
	    </p>

	    <h2 class="content-subhead">Who are the Staff?</h2>
	     <p>
               The list of current staff members are located at <a href="staff.html">mumble.jupiterbroadcasting.org/staff.html</a>.
	     </p>
	     <p>
	      <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> The people that run the shows and show hosts are <em>not necessarily staff members of this mumble server</em>. Please see the <a href="staff.html">staff page</a>.
	     </p>

	     <h2 class="content-subhead">Is there anything else I should know?</h2>
	     <p>
               Yes, but that would make this an awfully long quick start guide, wouldn't it! Please check the "FAQ" page located at <a href="faq.html">mumble.jupiterbroadcasting.org/faq.html</a>, and the "Things You Should Know" page located at <a href="thingsYouShouldKnow.html">mumble.jupiterbroadcasting.org/thingsYouShouldKnow.html</a> for further details.
